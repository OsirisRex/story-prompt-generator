# story-prompt-generator
A generator to create random writing excersises.

I created this for two reasons:

1. I want to have some good writing excersises that I do not have to manually choose a single thing.(Because I overthink things)

2. I want to learn about web design, specifically Javascript, but I find tutorials boring.

The way this generator is *supposed* to work is that it will show a random picture (the setting) and it will generate two basic characters (such as "murderer" "victim") and then will say "Write how (character 1) would see the place in the image, then write it again from the POV of (character 2).
